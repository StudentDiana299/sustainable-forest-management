# Forest Management Project

## Contribution to Sustainable Forest Management
This project uses technology to support forest conservation and climate action by:

- Calculating carbon sequestration to show forests’ role in absorbing CO₂.  
- Monitoring deforestation and illegal logging using digital tools.  
- Using sensors and data to track forest health and detect risks like fires.  
- Supporting education and awareness through simple applications.  

Together, these contributions help protect forests, promote sustainability, and fight climate change.
